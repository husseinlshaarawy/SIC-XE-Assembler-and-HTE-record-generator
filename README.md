# SIC-XE-Assembler-and-HTE-record-generator
This project implements an assembler for the SIC/XE architecture, capable of converting assembly language programs into machine code. The assembler also generates the corresponding HTE (Header, Text, End) records for use in object programs.

Features
Pass-1 Assembler: Constructs the symbol table, calculates addresses, and processes labels.
Pass-2 Assembler: Generates machine code and object program records.
HTE Record Generation:
Header Record (H): Contains program name, starting address, and program length.
Text Records (T): Contain machine instructions and data.
End Record (E): Indicates the end of the program and specifies the start address for execution.
Error Handling: Detects and reports errors like invalid opcodes, undefined symbols, and format mismatches.
Requirements
Programming Language: [Specify language, e.g., C++, Java, Python]
[Optional Dependencies or Libraries]
Usage
Provide the SIC/XE assembly code as input.
Run the assembler to generate:
Symbol table.
Object program.
HTE records.
Verify the output using sample programs or integrate it with a SIC/XE simulator.
